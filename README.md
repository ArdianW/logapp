A Django application has been developed to enable users to track their progress through the addition of entries. Upon registration, each user is granted exclusive access to their entries, facilitating monitoring, review, and editing of their progress. The application is designed in Polish and is hosted on render.com, where its design can be viewed. Originally, the application was intended for deployment on Heroku. However, Heroku now requires the insertion of a credit card, making it a paid service, which I am reluctant to use. Fortunately, render.com offers a free alternative, and I have successfully deployed my application there. However, it's important to note that not all features of the app can be accessed on render.com. Unfortunately, user registration and login pages are not functional due to the app requiring migration, and the pre-deploy option on render.com is also a paid feature. Nevertheless, you can still access the application via the link below:
